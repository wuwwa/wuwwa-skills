# Arc UI

Read [setup and component notes](references/setup.md) before integration. This is Collection's short adapter to the upstream Arc skill.

- Use existing Arc components for controls and overlays. Follow their documented props; use free items unless Pro access is provided.
- Import foundation once. Use semantic tokens, Inter for controls, and Geist for display headings; keep body copy short.
- Use one clear primary action per surface. Preserve the project's identity and the user's design preferences.
- Use motion to explain interaction; support keyboard operation and reduced motion.
- Check the actual screen on mobile and desktop, then run the project's checks.
