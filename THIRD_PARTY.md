# Arc UI

Free components installed from the [official Arc registry](https://uiarc.dev/docs/installation) on 2026-11-07:
button, search-field, segmented-control, dialog, select, empty-state, textarea, foundation and motion tokens.

Source is kept in `app/src/components/arc/`. See [Arc licensing](https://uiarc.dev/license).
Local accessibility fixes: the dialog close button and touch selection targets are at least 44px.
The catalog's external projects retain their original source and demo links in `catalog.json`.
